This code uses Googleâ€™s generativeai package to create a project plan based on a given project charter.
The plan is then processed into a structured list and saved as an Excel spreadsheet and a PowerPoint presentation.
The presentations slides use the generated tasks as titles and fill in other task details in the content.
